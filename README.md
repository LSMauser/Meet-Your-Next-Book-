NLP Final Project: Book Recommendation Web App

My final project for Intro to NLP will be a book recommendation web application. A book summaries dataset has been provided, which has each book's Wikipedia article ID, Freebase ID, Book title, Author, Publication date, Book Genres, and Plot summary. I plan to normalize and clean the book summaries data set and calculate a cosine similarity matrix to see what books are similar to each other. The user will input a book he or she likes, and the web application will recommend a book that is the most similar to the inputted book. If the user inputs a book that the search engine does not recognize (it is misspelled or does not exist within the given dataset) the web application will suggest another book as a starting point (similar to google search’s question “Did you mean?”).
